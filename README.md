## Motivation

Communication across communities through various forms of narratives necessarily rely on shared vocabularies whose content may diverge depending on which community uses it. Concepts in machine learning via this shared vocabulary are being used by many communities, however, diverging meanings arise as a result of disciplinary differences. 

This project, in conjunction with [Communication Across Communities in Machine Learning Research and Practice](https://sites.google.com/view/sedl-workshop/) at [ACM FACCT 2022](https://facctconference.org/2022/acceptedcraft.html) aims to build an inclusive lexicon of machine learning. We believe that building a shared vocabulary will help in cross disciplinary communication and will complement the other parts of this proposal.

## The Lexicon
