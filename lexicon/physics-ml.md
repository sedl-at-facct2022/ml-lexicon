# Convergent and Divergent Definitions in Physics, Machine Learning, and Beyond

This Lexicon Topic is inspired by the concepts discussed in the talk by [Savannah Thais](https://twitter.com/BasicScienceSav).

```{note}
Please add to these defintions with how your community may have differing defitions of these concepts.

### Uncertainty

Sources and definitions of uncertainty differ in Physics and Machine learning. 

- In physics, uncertainty can be defined in terms of the interval in which the true value lies. Sources of error are defined in terms of instrumental error, sytematic error, and random/statistical error.  Physics tends to take a bottom up approach to uncertainty quantification.

- In machine learning, we consider epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) sources of uncertainty.  Methods in ML seek to estimate and reduce these sources of uncertainty.  ML tends to take a top down approach to uncertainty quantification.

How does your community or the communities you work with define and attribute uncertainty?

### Interpretability and Explainability 

- In physics, a model is useful if the predictions are consistent with our knowledge of nature

- In machine learning, we focus on models that can parameterize representation and decisions into physical observables

```{note}
How does your community or the communities you work with determine if a model is useful?  What is the role of interpretability and explainability in your community?
```

### Data Bias

- In physics, sources of bias/error are known (e.g. use of simulated data and understanding of errors of measurements from instruments used in experiments)

- In machine learning, bias may not be about the fidelity of the underlying data. Additionally, the impact of the models must be considered.

### Knowledge Representation

- Physics itself can be seen as a form of knowledge representation.

- Machine learning, however, does not have as clear perscriptions for data representation.
