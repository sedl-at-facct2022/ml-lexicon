# An Inclusive ML Lexicon

Communication across communities through various forms of narratives necessarily rely on shared vocabularies whose content may diverge depending on which community uses it. Concepts in machine learning via this shared vocabulary are being used by many communities, however, diverging meanings arise as a result of disciplinary differences. This is a community-built, inclusive lexicon of machine learning. In building a shared vocabulary, we aim to help in cross disciplinary communication.

This lexicon pays particular attention to the social impact of AI (starting with a description of what AI is). Concepts are not only be descriptive but also prescriptive, especially for concepts with potential social impact. The lexicon will be built communally with preliminary work occuring at FACCT 2022 at the CRAFT Session.

Topics of interest include:

1. Building an inclusive lexicon focusing on diverging vocabulary

2. Usefulness for descriptions and the need for prescriptive entries in the lexicon

3. Baseline definitions and building a map of machine learning

4. Clarifying fuzzy concepts with prioritizing their social impact

We will include a discussion of related references.
